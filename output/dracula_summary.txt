Count Dracula is an ancient vampire of nobility from the remote mountains of Transylvania who resides alone in a decaying yet magnificent castle. He initially appears charming and welcoming but gradually reveals his true sinister and threatening nature. With his gaunt figure, waxen skin, high aquiline nose, pointed ears, sharp teeth and burning red eyes, Dracula exhibits a mysterious magnetism and power over humans, able to control animals and the weather. He attacks the innocent Jonathan Harker, later turning Lucy Westenra into a vampire. Persistent in his vampiric evil, Dracula possesses supernatural abilities and cunning intelligence, escaping capture multiple times. Though eloquent and refined on the surface, at his core Dracula is a ruthless predator who spreads his undead curse, requiring the combined efforts of Dr. Van Helsing and his allies to finally defeat him.
