In the late nineteenth century, I, Bram Stoker, crafted a Gothic tale that has enthralled readers for generations. It chronicles the experiences of Jonathan Harker, a young English solicitor who travels to Transylvania and becomes imprisoned by the mysterious Count Dracula. Harker's fianc√©e Mina and their friends soon realize something sinister is afoot, especially after Lucy Westenra dies from a strange wasting disease. The Dutch doctor Van Helsing recognizes she has become a vampire. He leads the others to uncover Dracula's origins and nature, pursuing the fiend back to Transylvania. After many tribulations, they finally destroy Dracula, releasing his undead victims and preventing his evil from spreading further. Though victory carries a grave cost, the friends' courage and sacrifice ultimately triumph over the forces of darkness.
