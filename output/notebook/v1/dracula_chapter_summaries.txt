Jonathan Harker travels by train from Munich to Bistritz, where he stays at the Hotel Royale before embarking on the final leg of his journey to meet Count Dracula. After receiving a welcoming letter from Dracula, Harker becomes uneasy based on the reactions of the hotel staff and locals. Along the route into the Carpathian Mountains, Harker observes the picturesque countryside and people. Upon arriving at the Borgo Pass, he is met by the Count's carriage rather than the public coach he was expecting.

Jonathan Harker arrives at Castle Dracula and meets Count Dracula, who welcomes him graciously but exhibits some strange behaviors and qualities, including immense strength, extremely cold hands, and no reflection in mirrors. Harker explores the castle, finding it a mix of ancient and modern but oddly lacking mirrors or servants. Dracula explains he must be away during the day but encourages Harker to rest and recover from his journey. The next day, Harker further explores the castle, finding a massive library of English books and newspapers despite Dracula's claim not to know English well. Dracula suddenly becomes enraged when Harker cuts himself shaving, making Harker realize the Count casts no reflection and cannot go out in daylight.
