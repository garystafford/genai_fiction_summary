Count Dracula is a mysterious and sinister Transylvanian nobleman residing in a decaying castle in the Carpathian Mountains. He possesses supernatural abilities and the strengths of a vampire, including immortality and the ability to control animals. Though courtly and charming on the surface, Dracula has a dark, evil nature and seeks to spread his vampirism, first to England and then beyond. He attacks the protagonist Jonathan Harker during Harker's visit to his castle and later preys upon Harker's fianc√©e Mina when he moves to England. This prompts Harker, Mina, and their friends to unite against Dracula in an effort to destroy him and prevent him from victimizing others.
