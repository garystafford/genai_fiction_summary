Dracula has an aristocratic bearing and commanding presence, but also exhibits unsettling traits like sharp teeth, red eyes, and exceptionally pale skin. He has supernatural abilities including controlling animals, scaling walls, and shape-shifting. Though cultured and intelligent, Dracula is also cunning, manipulative, and thoroughly evil. He attacks Jonathan Harker and later Lucy Westenra, transforming them into vampires. Dracula purchases property in London, spreading his vampiric curse. He is pursued by Van Helsing and the others who ultimately destroy him.
