 Count Dracula is an ancient, aristocratic vampire who resides in a decaying castle in the remote Carpathian Mountains of Transylvania. Polite yet sinister, he entraps the young English lawyer Jonathan Harker and attacks his fianc√©e Mina when pursuing his sinister goal of spreading his vampirism from Eastern Europe to England. Possessing supernatural powers, Dracula can control animals and weather, and transform himself into a bat or mist. Though cunning and ruthless, he is unable to withstand the determined efforts of Mina, her husband Jonathan, and their companions to track him down in England and destroy him. Their struggle against Dracula leads them to question the boundaries between science, superstition, and the mysterious realms beyond.
