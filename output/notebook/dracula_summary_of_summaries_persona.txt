The tale commences with Mr. Jonathan Harker's journey to Transylvania, whereupon meeting the peculiar Count Dracula he soon finds himself trapped in the ancient castle. Meanwhile in England, Mr. Harker's beloved Miss Mina Murray exchanges letters with her dear friend Miss Lucy Westenra, who receives proposals of marriage from three gentlemen. Miss Lucy accepts the hand of Lord Arthur Holmwood, whilst Mr. Harker's employer Dr. Seward puzzles over a manic patient named Renfield at his asylum. 

In Transylvania, Mr. Harker makes unsettling discoveries about Count Dracula before escaping the castle as the Count departs for England. Miss Lucy then falls mysteriously ill as strange events transpire, attracting the attention of the Dutch professor Van Helsing. Despite the Professor's efforts, Miss Lucy tragically perishes. However, sightings of Miss Lucy attacking children reveal she has become a vampire. Professor Van Helsing reluctantly leads Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris in ending Miss Lucy's undead torment.

Mr. Harker returns to England and reunites with Miss Murray, now his wife. Comparing notes, Mr. Harker and Professor Van Helsing determine Count Dracula is the root of these evil occurrences. Joining forces with Lord Godalming and the others, they embark on a dangerous quest to find the Count's remaining boxes of Transylvanian earth he needs for rest and destroy him before he creates more vampires. After many harrowing confrontations, the group finally tracks down Count Dracula as he flees back to Transylvania, destroying the monster and his vampire brides. Sadly, brave Mr. Quincey Morris perishes in the battle, but the survivors rejoice in vanquishing this vile fiend.
